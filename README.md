<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

pyAGE is an audio game engine written in Python, striving to be an all-in-one library for developing audio-only games on several operating systems like Windows, Linux or Mac OS.
With full Python 3 compatibility, including type-checking via MyPy, and extensibility in mind, it supports various screen readers and audio libraries and aims to be as flexible as possible.

Developing takes time and effort and since this project is free to use and open-source, I don't get anything out of it except appreciation. Appreciation doesn't pay monthly bills though.
